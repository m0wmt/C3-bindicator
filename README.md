# ESP32-C3 with WS2812B LEDs

My version of 'bindicator' originally written by Darren Tarbard. 

This project was written using Visual Studio Code and the PlatformIO extension to manage the project.

ESP32-C3 information: Chip Model ESP32-C3, ChipRevision 4, Cpu Freq 160, SDK Version v4.4.2

Libraries used: NeoPixel, ArduinoJson.

3D model of bin courtesy of Printables: https://www.printables.com/model/189899-wheelie-bin-for-the-bindicatorbindaycator, printed by my son-in-law

The Bin will light up a specific colour which will correspond to the colour of the bin that needs taking out that week. E.g. Red for general waste, Green and Blue for garden waste and recycling, and just Blue for the week our local council only collects recycling.

Currently in development.
